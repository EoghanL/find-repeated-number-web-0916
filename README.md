## Find the Repeated Number

We have an array with numbers ranging from 1...n, and every number appears once in that range, except one which appears twice. Write a method that finds the number that appears twice and returns that number.

For eg, given the array `[1,2,3,4,4,5,6]`, return `4`.

Get the tests to pass.
